Follow the steps to run the project in gazebo and see results.

1. Use ROSBOT_SIM command to run simulation on Gazebo (if not working refer to LAB manual 2 and 3 to set enviornment)
{Use Add Entity to add a sphere in view of the robot camera change the sphere color to dark blue from sphere visual frop down and selecting material option from the top as shown in screenshot}
2. make new directory with name "ros2_ws" 
3. create new package with name "tutorial_pkg"
4. in the src folder of the pacakge create publisher and subscriber files in .cpp format
5. now copy the code provided in the Github for publisher subscriber and CMAKE list
6. build the project using colcon build command
7. source the directory with "source ~/rosbot_ws/install/setup.bash" command
8. Open 2 new terminals to run publisher and subscriber seperately

At this step robot will be rotating in 360 and processing the images on each frame and detecting a blue ball in the frame. 
Also publishing message that no ball detected and subscriber will receive those messages.
As soon as a blue shaded ball is detected as shown in the screenshots the robot stops moving and keeps publishing blue ball detected.
